## Week 4

#### Logistics
Officer elections are coming up in two/three weeks. If you think you'd be interested in being on the officer board, I highly encourage you to apply. Every officer is required to lead a tier and participate in club events, such as RGB, CYMK, and HEX. There are also weekly meetings and stricter tabling requirements.

#### CSS Frameworks
We're going to go over some of the popular CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Materialize.

#### Javascript & JQuery
Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages of the web. To start, we won't be writing raw Javascript per say, but instead using a popular Javascript library called jQuery. In the programming languages you've already encountered, such as Python and Java, you've probably used some pre-existing libraries - abstracted functions implemented in the native language, to make your life just a little bit easier. This is what jQuery does for Javascript. In particular, we're going to look at how jQuery let's us manipulate the DOM and make AJAX requests. To start, we're going to go over some syntax basics by looking at <https://github.com/cle1994/InnoD_Web_Handbook/blob/master/6-javascript.md>.

Once we've had a chance to familiarize ourselves with Javascript syntax, let's try out this anagram problem, <http://jsfiddle.net/bssadswx/6/>. The website, jsfiddle, is a fun environment to test out writing code. For this fiddle, you should only modify the function, isAnagram. Their is a simple test case already written below.

Now, onto jQuery. To start, we're going to go over what events and selectors are. As a helpful guide, we're going to follow along here, <http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/>. On another note, w3schools is an amazing resource for tutorials and help in case you get stuck on a concept!

#### Javascript
JQuery is a Javascript library, meaning that any function written in Javascript, can also be written in jQuery. The index.html file for this week has several exercises that we'll go over.
