Innovative Design is a creative agency at the University of California, Berkeley. This repository contains the files and resources for our Web Exploration Tier, which focuses on teaching web design and development to beginners over the course of a semester. The team meets every week for two hours, and the READMEs found in each week serve as a rough agenda.
