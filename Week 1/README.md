## Week 1

#### HTML & CSS & JavaScript
Ah yes, the holy trinity, of web development. Over the course of the next semester, we're going to be learning how these technologies come together to make the beautiful web pages you see on the web today. And because I love metaphors, if you're going to call this our holy trinity, then one of our main religious texts is going to be:

You can read through the introduction when you have the time, but I'll be referencing material in here throughout the semester! If you ever get bored, feel free to read through it. There's a lot of useful information and links in there. Now, let's get started.

#### Your Friendly, Neighborhood Terminal
One of the most important things that you'll be learning about during this semester is how to work with your terminal, or command prompt. This application provides a text-based way to interact with your computer, and you'll find that it's unbelievable helpful. For starters, you can open up the application be searching for terminal on Mac, or command prompt on Windows. Here are a couple useful ones.

* cd _arg1_ - changes the current directory to _arg1_
* echo _arg1_ - prints _arg1_ to the console
* ls (Mac), dir (Windows) - prints all files and directories within your current directory

#### Text Editors
So what's the best approach to writing code? There are lots of different text editors out there, with fancy plugins and features, that can help out. A couple of the more popular ones are

* Sublime Text
* Atom
* VIM

Each one has it's pros and cons, and you can try them out as we go along and decide what you like best.

#### Wait, how did I write this?
Markdown is a popular language used on the web for creating aesthetically appealing text documents. You can read about the syntax (the way to write it) here <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>.

If you want to try writing some in your browser, just visit this link! It's will take whatever markdown you write and render it for you live!

You'll see a lot of web projects have a file called README.md which provides some context and information about the project itself.

#### Github & Git

Remember that holy book from earlier? Well it's back! I'm going to direct you guys to here to read a little bit about Github and Git, but we'll also go more in depth during meetings. We'll also make sure that everyone has accounts :)

On a completely unrelated note, do you know why this URL link has a #git at the end?
